## 📌 Project Overview

Most data analytics projects rely on disjointed tools (like Python, SQL, and Power BI), leading to data silos, complex maintenance, and data duplication. 

This project demonstrates a complete **Enterprise End-to-End Analytics Platform** built entirely on **Microsoft Fabric** to solve these exact challenges. It showcases the true power of a unified data platform by seamlessly integrating:
- **Data Factory** (Data Ingestion & Orchestration)
- **Data Engineering** (Processing with PySpark)
- **Data Warehousing** (Relational Modeling)
- **Business Intelligence** (Power BI & Direct Lake)

By working within a single workspace and utilizing **OneLake**, this solution ensures **Zero Data Duplication**. The data is stored once, and all personas—from Data Engineers to BI Developers—collaborate on the exact same dataset without breaking connections or moving data around.

The solution follows the **Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)** — taking raw CSV files and transforming them into a fully automated Business Intelligence solution. Built as hands-on preparation for the **DP-600: Implementing Analytics Solutions Using Microsoft Fabric** certification.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Large e-commerce businesses generate hundreds of thousands of transactions, and raw CSV exports alone cannot answer the questions the business actually needs answered:

- What are the best-selling products and categories?
- Which sellers and states generate the highest revenue?
- Which customers purchase repeatedly, and what drives retention?
- How reliable is delivery performance, and where does it break down?
- Which payment methods dominate, and how do installments behave?

Answering these reliably — and keeping the answers current every day without manual work — requires a proper analytics platform, not a one-off spreadsheet analysis. That's the gap this project closes.

## 🔄 Project Workflow

**1. Workspace** — `Fabric-EndToEnd-ECommerce` created on Microsoft Fabric.

**2. Lakehouse** — `Sales_Lakehouse` created with folder structure: `Bronze / Silver / Gold / Archive / Scripts / Documentation`.

**3. Bronze Layer** — All 9 raw CSV files uploaded as-is (no transformation).

**4. PySpark Notebook** (`02_Data_Cleaning`) — performed:
- ✔ Reading all 9 CSV files
- ✔ Data profiling (row counts, null checks, duplicate checks) *before* any cleaning
- ✔ Duplicate removal
- ✔ Missing value handling based on root cause, not blanket deletion
- ✔ Data type conversion
- ✔ Feature engineering (delivery days, late-delivery flag, installment buckets, etc.)
- ✔ Saved as Delta Tables

**5. Silver Layer** — 8 cleaned Delta tables: `silver_customers`, `silver_orders`, `silver_order_items`, `silver_products`, `silver_payments`, `silver_reviews`, `silver_sellers`, `silver_geolocation`.

**6. Gold Staging** — Dataflow Gen2 (`DF_Gold_Staging`) merges `order_items` with `products` and `sellers`, adds `RevenuePerItem`, and applies incremental refresh.

**7. Data Warehouse** (`Sales_Warehouse`) — Star Schema with surrogate keys:
- **Dimensions**: `DimCustomer`, `DimProduct`, `DimSeller`, `DimDate`, `DimLocation`
- **Facts**: `FactOrderItems`, `FactPayments`

**8. Semantic Model** (`Sales_SemanticModel`) — relationships across the star schema + DAX measures (sales, time intelligence, customer, delivery, payments).

**9. Power BI** — 8-page interactive report + executive dashboard with pinned KPIs and alerts.

**10. Publish** — Report published to the Fabric workspace, pinned to a dashboard.

**11. Automation** — `PL_Daily_Refresh` pipeline: Notebook → Dataflow → Warehouse refresh → Semantic Model refresh, scheduled daily, with failure notifications.

## 🔍 Data Profiling & Engineering Decisions

Every cleaning decision below is based on an **actual profiling pass** over the real dataset (row counts, null checks, duplicate checks via PySpark) — not assumptions.

| Table | Rows | Duplicate Rows | Needs Cleaning? |
|---|---|---|---|
| customers | 99,441 | 0 | No |
| orders | 99,441 | 0 | Yes (nulls) |
| order_items | 112,650 | 0 | No |
| products | 32,951 | 0 | Yes (nulls) |
| order_payments_dataset | 103,886 | 0 | No |
| order_reviews | 99,224 | 0 | Yes (text nulls) |
| sellers | 3,095 | 0 | No |
| geolocation | 1,000,163 | **261,836** | **Yes — highest priority** |
| product_category_name_translation | 71 | 0 | No |

**`geolocation` — the biggest finding in the whole dataset:** 261,836 of 1,000,163 rows (≈26.2%) were exact duplicates. Rather than a blind drop, duplicates were removed and coordinates were aggregated (averaged lat/lng) at the zip-code-prefix level, producing ~19-20K clean location records.

**`orders` — nulls tied to real order status, not bad data:** 160 rows missing `order_approved_at`, 1,783 missing `delivered_carrier_date`, 2,965 missing `delivered_customer_date` — all explained by orders still in transit or cancelled. A `DeliveryStatus` column (`Not Delivered Yet` / `Late` / `On Time`) was derived instead of dropping any row.

**`products` — 610 rows missing category/descriptive data:** Imputed with `"unknown"` rather than dropped, since these products are tied to real transactions in `order_items` and dropping them would silently lose sales history.

**`order_reviews` — 88% missing titles, 59% missing comment text:** Normal customer behavior (star rating without a written comment), handled with placeholder text and a `HasWrittenReview` flag rather than treated as a data quality issue.

**Additional engineering choices:**
- Numeric **surrogate keys** on all dimension tables instead of long text business keys, for warehouse join performance.
- **OneLake Shortcuts** instead of physical copies between Lakehouse and Warehouse (One Copy principle).
- **Incremental Refresh** in Dataflow Gen2 instead of full reloads on every run.

DimCustomer ── FactOrderItems ── DimProduct
                       │
                  DimSeller

FactOrderItems ── FactPayments   (on order_id)
DimCustomer ── DimLocation       (on zip_code_prefix)
```
